# Rockbuster Analysis
This is an SQL based project looking at and analysing online movie rental data for a fictitious company named 'Rockbuster Stealth LLC', as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics course.
# Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company, looking to move away from being primarily store based and instead focus resources on launching an online video rental service in order to try and stay competitive against the major streaming platforms. My task as a data analyst for the business intelligence department is to help with the launch strategy by analysing the data using SQL. Finally, I will expand on this analysis by answering any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
# Tools
PostgreSQL is the database system I have used, managed through the pgAdmin 4 application.
# Data
CareerFoundry provided a dataset containing the following tables:
- Customer
- Store
- Film Category
- Film actor
- Rentals
- Staff
- Payment
- Address
- City
- Country
- Actor
- Film
- Inventory
- Category
- Language

The data can be found [here](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip).
# Additional Resources
As well as SQL queries, I have provided a Data Dictionary and my final presentation to Rockbuster.
